# dataset-generator

Welcome to the Dataset Generator open-source project authored by Pat Dixon (Pulmac Systems) and Alia Rezvi.

Please read the 'Documentation.pdf' file for an introduction and instructions on how to run/modify the application.

The 'generator' directory holds the application and all external library licenses/notices can be found in the 'generator\main\libraries' directory.

The 'documents' directory holds relevant information about the current dataset generator's variables and calculations.

The 'NetBeans.zip' file is an older, modified version of the project which allows for GUI configuration using the NetBeans GUI editor. Details can be found in the 'Documentation.pdf' file.
